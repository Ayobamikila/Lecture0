# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project is a simple webpage that consist of hyperlinks which can to take you to different pages.

It also implements bootsrap styling and grid system.

The table of content in the website are links which can take you to anywhere in the page you desire to go. 

The backend of the webpage consist of 1 css stylesheet file which implements css properties and some selectors.

The website is also mobile responsive allowing it to change background colors when it's reduced to a certain size.

The two errors I encountered when developing the site are;

1. In the table of contents numbers 5-8 when clicked can't take the user to where it's located on the website.

2. When I tried to compile the scsss file to css using git bash I was always getting the error "bash: sass: command not found"
